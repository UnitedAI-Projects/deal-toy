//! MantelCAD's look, ready to install into the UI kit (`mantelcad_ui_kit`): its icon masters and
//! colour roles ([`icons`]), its code-drawn glyphs ([`glyphs`]), its IBM Plex interface faces
//! ([`fonts`]) and its built-in themes ([`themes`]). The kit ships none of these; a host that wants
//! MantelCAD's look installs them from here, so there is one copy of each.
//!
//! [`install`] installs all of it. A host that wants only some, or MantelCAD's icons with a few
//! masters of its own ([`icons::DATA`] in a `mantelcad_ui_kit::icons::IconSet::extended`),
//! installs the parts instead. MantelCAD's workspace tabs are the app's, not the look's.
